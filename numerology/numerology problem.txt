Numerology problem

Destiny number
To arrive at your Destiny number, take each name separately and add up the letter values using the conversion chart below. Reduce each name to a single digit . Then add the results of all of the names to arrive at a total which you then once again reduce to a single digit.


 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
 a   b   c   d   e	 f 	 g	 h 	 i
 j	 k	 l   m	 n	 o   p   q   r
 s   t   u   v   w   x   y   z  


Example of Destiny Number: DAVID MICHAEL McCLAIN, David equals 22/4, Michael equals 33/6, and McClain equals 28 which reduces to 10/1. The Destiny number is 4+6+1=11, and 11, a master number, becomes 11/2. My Destiny Number is 11/2.
